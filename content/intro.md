# Welcome

The laboratory for brain simulation and exploration is located in Montreal and affiliated with the [CRIUGM](https://criugm.qc.ca/), [CSS-MTL](https://ciusss-centresudmtl.gouv.qc.ca/) and [Université de Montréal](). The main objective of the lab is to train artificial neural networks in order to jointly mimic individual human brain activity and behaviour. To achieve that goal, we lead an intensive effort of individual data collection in neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG), the Courtois project on neuronal modelling ([CNeuroMod](https://cneuromod.ca)). The SIMEXP lab also applies machine learning techniques to identify robust markers of brain disorders in multisite data, most notably as part of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging ([CCNA](https://ccna-biomarkers.readthedocs.io/)).
